## Language learning in context

Hallo! I'm Jordi Rosell. I created <a href="https://jrosell.github.io/language-learning-in-context/">this application</a> to help users like myself <strong>acquire new German vocabulary in context</strong>.

With this app, as a German learner, you can:

- Click on a word to view, update, or add its definition, new/learning/learned status, and usage examples with images and YouTube links.
- Click New text to use any text you want.
- Edit, download, or upload your vocabulary using a CSV file format. (Yes, you can load your words by simply copying and pasting them or uploading a CSV.)
- Download all the images you upload in a zip file.

Known issues:

- It’s not multilingual (yet). The settings assume you are learning German.
- The text is not saved. Only your vocabulary and images are saved in your browser. It cannot (yet) be shared across multiple devices.
- This app uses a consent manager to track only users who have agreed to analytics tracking (aka. Google Analytics).
- Mobile user experience is bad. At the moment, you'd better use wide screens.
- At this time, it only supports English letters and letters like äöüáéíóúàèìòùâêß.
- Examples (still) not work for mulitple words.
- You (still) cannot upload/donlowad images for your examples. Examples (still) not work for mulitple words.

Let me know what you think. And if you want, you can <a href="https://github.com/jrosell/language-learning-in-context/">contribute or open an issue</a>.

I hope you enjoy it,<br><a href="https://mastodon.social/@jrosell">@jrosell</a></p>
