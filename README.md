## Language learning in context

Hallo! I'm Jordi Rosell. <a href="https://jrosell.github.io/language-learning-in-context/">This application</a> was created by me to <strong>help users like me adquiring new german vocabulary in context</strong>.

With this app you, as a german learner, can:

- Click one word to see/update/add its definition, new/learning/learned status and usage examples with images and youtube links.
- Click New text to use the text you want.
- Edit/download/upload your vocabulary using a CSV file format (Yes you can load your words here with simply copy&pasting them or uploading a CSV).
- You can download all the images you upload in a zip file.

Known issues:

- At the time, it only supports english and äöüáéíóúàèìòùâêß letters in words.</li>
- It's not multilingual (yet?) . The settings assume you are learning german.</li>
- The text is not saved. Only your vocabulary and images are saved in your browser. It can't (yet?) be shared on multiple devices.

Let me know what you think.

I hope you enjoy it,<br><a href="https://mastodon.social/@jrosell">@jrosell</a></p>
